# HTML-Canvas-Game

A simple game created entirely in javascript via the HTML canvas tag. 
I created this game while following along with the tutorial found here: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/

Controls:

Move mouse and click to shoot! Kill the enemies falling from the top!
